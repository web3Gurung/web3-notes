gm everyone!

Yesterday, I was a part of the creator meetup conducted by @ogclubdao x @crowdpadcrew

We had talks about types of creators, artists x NFTs, food-verse and the beer x brewery community.

Here are some takeaways from the meetup!


Creators and types of creators by @preetika

Choose your 3 niche adjective and stick to that while creating content. Eg, humour/serious and minimalist/detailed.

If you don't follow this, then it can create a disconnect with your audience. Your audience also come for your vibes!

2 types of leaders
a. Key opinion leader
	- they are already someone at the peak
	- they represent some organisation/profession
	- eg, journalist, doctors
	
b. Influencers (preetika doesn't like this term btw)
	- they engage people
	- have a following where people trust them (blindly) based on the rapport they have built
	- are generally people who did not start as someone already at the peak.
	
	
Next, @burgundy (Sakshi) talked about NFTs and its use cases.

Sakshi has her project called KaariKollective. It all started when she went to Gujarat in 2019 with her sis. They met artists and noticed how they didn't know how to monitize and sell properly.

Eg, artists sold a piece of cloth at Rs. 100 and in city it costed around 5k for the same cloth.

With her project, kaarikollective, they aim to help artists to monitise talent and skills. Done with the help of NFTs.

She talked about how Royalty is a big factor in NFTs which can help artists earn even after selling ***their craft to someone for the first time.***


In short, she told how all of this can be linked
ownership + monitization = NFTs + royalty

In web2, movies and pictures (an example) are seen as a service and not as an asset. With web3, this changes as IP (intellextual property) comes into play.

We had a discussion of how we're still early and exploring with NFT use cases.

Nfts having limited supply make it exclusive access. Wwe talked about BYAC, 1st tweet made into NFT, NBA shots, brand value behind the community.

Next up, we had Crypto kabab, who told us how he was the top 25 poeple who gotreceived the NAS fellowship.

He along with Jenna, are the people behind the largest following of poeple associated with beer.

The breweries selling craftbeer in karnataka have been associated with their community. Epic.

He started as a DJ, and as he performed in pubs and breweries, he asked the brewers to make exclusive flavours. And soon enough a community was created!

Jenna told how its hard to connect people virtually to members than members who are in irl events.

What if I told you that this person is creating a tiktok x netflix platform for food. AND you can order what you see or even book a table at the restaurant based on the food you saw?

Zafir Syed is doing the same with Blendverse. In short, it is ecommerce for food!

The food content creator who showcases the restaurant gets a commision for the same, which isn't there in the current business model.


His background is from Mechanical Engineering and has explored regions in India for
- exploring the history of the food
- ingredients
- geographic aspect affecting the cuisine

He's creating this platform since in fashion industry, content creators can become fulltime creator, but not food creators.

With this platform, a person can also start their food chain and this is the first kind of platform. We're early!
